The work to evaluate addiction as a risk factor for the Alzheimer's disease:

extract_intersection_ADvap_DTU_DEG.py: We tried to find common genes that are differentially expressed in human Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's exacerbated due to induced alcohol addiction in mice. The former results are published in - ["Differential transcript usage unravels gene expression alterations in Alzheimer’s disease human brains"] (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-020-00052-5#Sec21) and the latter ones in - ["A History of Repeated Alcohol Intoxication Promotes Cognitive Impairment and Gene Expression Signatures of Disease Progression in the 3xTg Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease"] (https://www.eneuro.org/content/10/7/ENEURO.0456-22.2023)
